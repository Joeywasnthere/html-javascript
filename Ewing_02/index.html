    <p>My name is Joseph Ewing, but most people call me Joey. I am from Higganum, Connecticut, which is a half hour from the capital. Originally, I am from Killingworth, Connecticut. Killingworth borders Higganum so it is not too far from each other. I moved around three months ago, and I love the new house. For school I started out at Our Lady of Mercy in Madison for grades K-8. Unfortunately, that school was demolished a few years ago. I graduated from Xavier Highschool in Middletown last year in 2020. Coming from Catholic schools to a new school in Rhode Island was a bit intimidating but everything is going good so far. I did not start out doing game design as my program. My first was mechanical engineering, which was good, but I didn’t enjoy completely, and I couldn’t see myself doing it in the future. Now I feel more comfortable where I am at now.
        In Connecticut, I work as a delivery driver for a pizza restaurant. With my job along with school I am always on the road. Also, in Connecticut I live with my parents, my older sister, and my younger brother. I’m known for being loud and goofy, which is surprising because in public I am quiet and have the personality of a toaster. The reason is because I’m shy and get really nervous around new and big groups of people.
